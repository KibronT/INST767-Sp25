### Scope of Project

For this final project we will all need to write DAGs that pull data from an API, clean it, and then load it into BigQuery. The point of this is to practice using Google Cloud Platform. Each week there will be some issue posted here that you must complete. The issues will involve writing code that uses Google Cloud Platform services like BigQuery and Cloud Storage to solve the problem.


### Structure

Everyone must work on their own. Please make a folder for your project and put all the files in it. The foler needs to be your first name and lastname formatted as `firstname_lastname`.

### Objective

The objective of the project is to write a DAG that intergrates multiple big data sources together. You will need create a system on Google Cloud to do this. How you design the system is up to you, including what Google Cloud technologies you use. You must select 3 different data apis that have conistently updating data. Check out [Public APIs](https://publicapis.io/) for inspiration when selecting apis.

In general your system will need to follow something like this:
