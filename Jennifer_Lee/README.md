For my project, I will be creating a DAG for financial market data. 

I will be using https://publicapis.io/yahoo-finance-api, https://publicapis.io/coin-gecko-api, and https://publicapis.io/fred-api.
The first API is Yahoo Finance, and it consists of financial market data. 
The second API is CoinGecko and contains information on cryptocurrency prices.
The third API is the Federal Reserve Economic Data and has macroeconomic data. 

I will use all of these APIs to analyze trends and correlations in the stock market throughout time and predict trends.
