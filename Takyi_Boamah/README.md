# Sustainability Analytics Pipeline

## Project Overview

My project aims to implement a data pipeline that ingests, transforms, and analyzes sustainability-related data from multiple APIs. The goal is to collect carbon emissions data, electricity production information, and weather patterns. This data can be used in the future to provide insights into environmental impacts and help identify opportunities for reducing carbon footprints.

## Data Sources

The pipeline integrates the following APIs:

### 1. Carbon Interface API

- Provides carbon emissions data for various activities and energy sources.
- Offers estimates for electricity usage, transportation, and more.
